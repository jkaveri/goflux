/*
Package channel provides a comprehensive set of utilities for working with Go channels,
offering advanced channel operations, transformations, and flow control mechanisms.
This package aims to simplify complex channel-based concurrent programming patterns
by providing high-level abstractions for common operations.

Key Features:

  - Channel Composition: Combine multiple channels using operations like Join, Split, and Tee
  - Channel Transformation: Transform channel data using Map, Filter, and Reduce operations
  - Flow Control: Manage channel flow with Buffer, RateLimit, and Timeout mechanisms
  - Batch Processing: Process channel data in batches for improved efficiency

Common Use Cases:

  - Stream Processing: Transform and filter data streams in real-time
  - Fan-out/Fan-in Patterns: Distribute work across multiple goroutines
  - Rate Limiting: Control the flow of data through channels
  - Batch Processing: Accumulate items for bulk operations
  - Event Broadcasting: Send events to multiple consumers
  - Timeout Handling: Add timeouts to channel operations

Example Usage:

Here's a simple example that demonstrates several features of the package:

	// Create some source channels
	ch1 := make(chan int)
	ch2 := make(chan int)

	// Combine reads from both channels
	merged := channel.JoinReads(ch1, ch2)

	// Transform the values
	doubled := channel.Map(merged, func(x int) int {
		return x * 2
	})

	// Filter out odd numbers
	evens := channel.Filter(doubled, func(x int) bool {
		return x%2 == 0
	})

	// Process in batches of 10
	batches := channel.Batch(evens, 10)

	// Add rate limiting
	limiter := myRateLimiter // implements RateLimiter interface
	rateLimited := channel.RateLimit(batches, limiter)

The package is designed to be generic and type-safe, utilizing Go's generics support
to work with channels of any type while maintaining compile-time type safety.

Thread Safety:

All operations in this package are designed to be thread-safe and can be safely used
in concurrent environments. The package handles proper channel closure and cleanup
to prevent goroutine leaks.

Error Handling:

The package follows Go's idioms for channel closure and error handling. When input
channels are closed, the corresponding output channels are automatically closed
after processing any remaining items. This ensures proper cleanup and prevents
goroutine leaks.

Performance Considerations:

While the package provides high-level abstractions, it's designed to be efficient
and minimize overhead. However, users should be aware that some operations (like
Batch and Buffer) may introduce memory overhead due to data buffering.

individual function documentation.
